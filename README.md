# Arduino-Keypad-Calculator
This is a short C++ based piece of code that uses the Arduino and a 4x4 keypad. (Check readme for more details).

You can use this code wherever you want, but a reference is greatly appreciated!
To use this code you need to connect a 4x4 button matrix, where the 1st Pin on the keypad goes to Pin 13 on the Arduino, 2nd Pin - 12th Pin, etc. Make sure to also link the KeyPad library on the IDE, by going to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries > Search for "keypad" > Install the library "Keypad" by Mark Stanley and Alexander Brevig.
